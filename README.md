Generating artistic style painting using GAN

Make a dataset of images of a specific painter.
Upload it to forked github repo suryakantk94/artistgan.
Create a pull request to official github repo(venkatesh)after pushing to your own repository.
Then, use it in the kaggle notebook. Change all the previous painter name to this painter's name dataset and change batch size to total images in the dataset.
Copy link address of both the g_model AtoB & BtoA and use !wget to get them downloaded in the current session in the colab notebook.
Finally, use !cp command to move it to the drive from session storage or drag and drop directly to the drive.
